# utiltools-angular
utiltools using angular

This is same as utiltools repository but here instead of javascript, angularjs is used.

Here you can find calculator, todo-list and notepad. Although, the pages are static and data will be lost on page refresh
or on closing th browser window. This site do not save any data. 

If anyone want to do any changes let me know or pull a new branch. I will review and update it accordingly.
You can use this as a template for projects etc. This was made when i started learning angularJS, so it's not all great. There might
be issues.

Please let me know about the bugs, and its fix if you know. Otherwise, I will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Enjoy!!
